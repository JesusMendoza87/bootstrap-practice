                    <p class="par-indent">Bamm-Bamm Rubble (sometimes spelled Bam-Bam Rubble) is a fictional character in the Flintstones franchise, the adopted son of Barney and Betty Rubble. He is most famous in his infant form on the animated series, but has also appeared at various other ages, including as a teenager on the early 1970s spin-off The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show and as an adult in three television films. Cartoonist Gene Hazelton contributed to the original model sheets for the character, and he has said that he based Bamm-Bamm's design on his own son, Wes</p>

              <p class="par-indent">It all started when I met Dora Exploradora.  What an influence I tell ya!!! She invited me on a ride along to pick up some guy name Diego. Little did I know this was a setup to pick him up from a robbery at Famous Footwear.  I didn't know what shoes were. Long story short Diego tripped with a smile on his face.  So we waited, got arrested and ended up in jail. And that's where I met Mike Tyson.  One of most vicious, ruthless, Alah praising boxers ever. He taught me how to fight and use my strength even further. I threw mom's couches out the window at one point. Once we were released I definately used Mikes techniques on Diego. Bamm-Bamm Bye-Bye Amigo! </p>
              <p class="par-indent">Later that evening, an alien named E-Musk abducted me.  He told me that in the future there would be these things called computers where we could communicate and make cool profiles like these.</p>
              <p class="par-indent">All in all Dora looks innocent but she isn't.  Mike Tyson is crazy in the outs but a loving caring man in the inside. As for the alien, E-Musk, he didn't even "phone-home" he just disappeared standing up. But I'm still stronger than all of them. Just don't tell the green guy! </p>
